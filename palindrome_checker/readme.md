# contact_saver project in C

This is my **second C project**, published under the `projects-2025/palindrome_checker` directory. It is a **mini palindrome checker**, fully written in the C programming language.


# ðŸš€ Features

- Accepts both **words and sentences** as input
- **Automatically filters out** digits, symbols, and spaces â€” only alphabetic characters are considered
- Case-insensitive logic (converts all characters to lowercase)
- Uses **dynamic memory allocation** for flexible input handling


## How to run

1. Open terminal
2. Compile:
   ```bash
   gcc project2.c -o palindrome_checker
3. run the program
   ./palindrome_checker
